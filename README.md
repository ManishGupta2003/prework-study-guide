# prework-study-guide

##A study guide for course pre-work.

This project is a prework-study-guide and my very first coding project! 
This project helped me learn the basics of coding and get a better understanding of what coding is! 
I learned how the terminal works, the basics of html, the basics of CSS and I got to see a little insight on how JavaScript works!
